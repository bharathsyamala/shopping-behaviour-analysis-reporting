# Shopping Behaviour Analysis Reporting


## Objective

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis using PostgreSQL and designing dashboards using Tableau for business analysis and performance review. This project is a continuation of my [SQL Data Warehouse Engineering](https://github.com/bharathsyamala/sql-data-warehouse-engineering/) project, which uses a Medallion Architecture to clean raw data into business-ready tables.
